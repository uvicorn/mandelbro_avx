## Mandelbrot set drawing with AVX2 intrinsics

Because I did not want to compile SFML graphic lib from WSL to Windows, I Visual Studio, not bad, but Vim is better :)

SFML allowed to move across the screen with touchpad, mouse clicks (shift the center & zoom), mouse wheel scrolling, keyboard (+/- to zoom in/out); resize the screen and more and more.
